# üéì Student Dashboard Features - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for adding all requested student view features to the Hapi AI dashboard. The goal is to create a comprehensive, functional, and usable student experience.

## Current Status Analysis

### ‚úÖ Already Implemented (in Academics Hub)
These features exist but are in the Academics tab, not the main dashboard:

1. **Current course grade** - ‚úÖ EnhancedGradesView.tsx
2. **Upcoming assignments** - ‚úÖ EnhancedGradesView.tsx  
3. **Grade momentum/trends** - ‚úÖ EnhancedGradesView.tsx with projections
4. **AI Calendar view** - ‚úÖ UnifiedCalendar.tsx
5. **AI workload assistant** - ‚úÖ LoadMeterGauge.tsx + SchedulingAssistant.tsx
6. **AI tutor** - ‚úÖ CourseTutorMode.tsx with Chatbase integration
7. **Mood vs. grade correlation** - ‚úÖ MoodGradeAnalytics.tsx

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented
These features exist in basic form but need enhancement:

1. **Class participation report** - Basic data exists in mockData, needs UI component
2. **Daily pulse score** - Exists in morning pulse, needs dashboard widget
3. **Mood tracker chart** - PersonalSentimentChart exists, needs 7/30/custom day views
4. **Total Hapi points** - Shown in StatsBar, needs detailed breakdown
5. **Consecutive streak days** - Shown in StatsBar, needs gamification context
6. **Class rank** - ClassLeaderboard exists, needs per-class view

### ‚ùå Not Yet Implemented
These features need to be built from scratch:

1. **Number of late/missing assignments** - Need to calculate from Canvas data
2. **Mood variability (emotional stability)** - Need algorithm + visualization
3. **Hapi moments and analysis** - Basic data exists, needs analysis UI
4. **Badges earned** - Need badge system + display
5. **Scoreboard per class** - Need per-class leaderboard widget
6. **Daily to-dos** - TodaysTasks exists but needs expansion
7. **Emotional trajectory summary** - Need AI-generated summary
8. **Academic focus score** - Need calculation algorithm
9. **Academic risk indicator (per class)** - Need risk detection algorithm
10. **Wellbeing indicator (per class)** - Need wellbeing scoring per class

### üö´ Explicitly Excluded
- **Payment and membership management tab** - NO (per requirements)

```typescript
interface AssignmentStatus {
  upcoming: Assignment[];      // Due within 7 days
  dueSoon: Assignment[];        // Due within 2 days
  late: Assignment[];           // Past due, not submitted
  missing: Assignment[];        // Not submitted, past grace period
  completed: Assignment[];      // Submitted and graded
}
```

**UI Elements:**
- Count badges for each status
- Color coding (red=late, orange=due soon, green=completed)
- Click to expand and see list
- Quick actions (submit, view details)

---

### 2. Mood Tracker Enhanced
**Location:** Main dashboard, middle section

**Features:**
- Toggle between 7-day, 30-day, custom range
- Line chart with emotion labels
- Mood variability score display
- Emotional stability indicator
- Trend analysis (improving/declining/stable)

**Calculations:**
```typescript
// Mood Variability = Standard deviation of intensity scores
moodVariability = stdDev(intensityScores)

// Emotional Stability = Inverse of variability (0-100)
emotionalStability = 100 - (moodVariability * 10)
```

## Questions for Clarification

1. Should widgets be customizable (show/hide, reorder)?
2. What's the priority order for features?
3. Should we implement real-time updates or polling?
4. Do we need admin controls for feature flags?
5. Should students be able to export their data?
