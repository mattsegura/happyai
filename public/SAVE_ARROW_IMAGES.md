# Save Arrow Images

Please save your two arrow images to the public folder:

1. **Students Arrow** (the one with "Students" text pointing down-left):
   - Save as: `/Users/nicolasdooman/Desktop/happyai/public/students-arrow.png`
   - This will appear on the **Teachers section** to indicate you can switch to Students
