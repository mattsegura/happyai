## Notes

- These are demo accounts meant for testing only
- In production, use strong, unique passwords
- Admin accounts should be created manually for security
- The role system is enforced both client-side and server-side (via RLS policies)

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid login credentials"
- Make sure the accounts are created in Supabase
- Check that the passwords match exactly
- Ensure email confirmation is disabled for demo accounts

### Wrong dashboard showing
- Check the `role` column in the `profiles` table
- Clear browser localStorage and try logging in again
- Make sure the role is set correctly in the database

### Can't access admin features
- Admin role must be set directly in the database
- Cannot be selected during signup for security reasons
- Check that role is set to `admin` or `super_admin` in profiles table
